<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
  My name is Jeongyeon Kim.
  I was born in 1998 at Seoul, South Korea.
  I am a curious graduate student eager to study python for my own purpose, which is "quantitative funding."
  I graduated Sookmyung Girls' Highschool in Seoul, South Korea.
  I was selected as one of the Korea-Japan Joint Government Scholarship Receiver from January 2017 to March 2022.
  I graduated Electric, Electronic, and Information Engineering Department of Nagoya University in Japan.
  I entered the graduate school of Electrical Engineering (EE) of Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in August 2022.
  However, I transferred my major to Business and Technology Management (BTM) in August 2023.
  Now fully enjoying my study, I am eager to develop myself as an aggressive creator who develops its own new world.</p>
